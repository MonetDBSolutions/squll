# A sample sqlprobe configuration file
# This file should live within the directory from which you start the program.

[DEFAULT]
# The default section contains the properties shared for all target systems.
# The home directory is the base for system specific directors and libraries
home=/Users/mlkersten

# The main property is the IP adress to reach a SQLscalpel service
# server = localhost:5000
server = localhost:5000

# The prime purpose of sqlprobe is to run databas experiments on
# behalf of registered sqlscalpel users or their team members.
# The project owner may block all experimental results that are
# likely not genuine, e.g. faked user, duplicate results, or timeout at the server.
user = mk
key = # to be determined

# sqlscalpel differentiates the hosts on which experiments are ran with a nickname
# this way one can conceal the actual host name, releasing only basis host properties.
host=myMac

# the default target can be set as a global property
target = UNKNOWN

# Long running experiments can be costly, espcially in a Cloud setting.
# Therefore, when the DBMS has an option to timeout a query, it can use this
# global time out property (in seconds)
timeout = 60

# For debugging purposes one can turn on this flag
debug = true

# don't stop the driver, otherwise stop upon error or out of work
forever= true

# After too many database errors bail out to assess the scalpel grammar
# A value 0 means never to bail out, otherwise it is the number of errors allowed
bailout = 0

# All experiments are ran a number of times.
# Preferably a number of times, because the first
# run typically warms up the database engine.
#
repeat = 5

# TARGET SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS
# The sections are specific to the target DBMS identified by their local nickname(=product)
# Upon need additional key=value pairs can be given to instruct the corresponding driver
# The 'db' is a list of database contacted in a round-robing fashion
# Arbitrary project/experiments can be indicated with the wildcard '*'
# The database location 'dbfarm' can be used in most circumtances as alternative to the 'db'
# IMPORTANT - For JDBC connections, the JAVA_HOME environmental variable should be set!
